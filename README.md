# JavaFX17 Book Exercises & Code Snippets

This repo is about practicing the JavaFX17 using the book Learn JavaFX17 as a guide and implementing the code. Each chapter code will be divided into its own branches and any significant apps will have their own branches as well.

Please switch branches to view more examples of JavaFX17

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
